In the mystic tale of an ancient legend of a ninja known as Yasuke who lived long long ago in the village of Angbotain who was from Shinobi of the nature clan. Yasuke was an African ninja whose achievements went unrecognized because of his race. His sensei Shimura sensed his talent and honesty when he found him in an orphanage. Young Yasuke was then adopted and trained into a ninja.


Months passed and a deadly illness prevailed where chaos and fear rose in the village. After long search of medicines by a famous physician Shigeaki Hinohara a friend of sensei shimura told that the deadly disease can only be cured by the roots of Licorice, a medicinal plant only in the depths of Koran valley where roots of Licorice fall off from the heavy winds at the time. The valley was impossible to climb due severe winds. He warned the roots of water hemlocks were also prone to fall making it a menacing task.
